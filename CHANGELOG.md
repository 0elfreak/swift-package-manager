Swift 3.0
---------

* It is no longer necessary to run `swift build` before running `swift test` (it
  will always regenerates the build manifest when necessary). In addition, it
  now accepts (and requires) the same `-Xcc`, etc. options as are used with
  `swift build`.

* The `Package` initializer now requires the `name:` parameter.
